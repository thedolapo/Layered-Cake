# Layered Cake - Three.js

A beautiful 3D layered cake visualization built with Three.js. This interactive cake features multiple layers, decorative frosting drips, and a Victorian-style stand.

## About

I was working on a project and needed a 3D cake rendered in a canvas on the web. This is the result - a fully interactive, beautifully textured layered cake built with Three.js that can be embedded anywhere on the web.

## Features

- 🎂 **Multi-layered cake** with red, cream, and yellow sponge layers
- 🎨 **Textured materials** with procedurally generated sponge textures
- 💧 **Decorative icing drips** along the outer edge
- 🏺 **Victorian-style stand** with decorative stem and base
- 🎭 **Interactive controls** - rotate and zoom using OrbitControls
- ✨ **Realistic lighting** with shadows and ambient lighting

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The project uses ES modules and imports Three.js from a CDN, so no build process is required.

## Technologies

- **Three.js** (v0.152.2) - 3D graphics library
- **OrbitControls** - Camera controls for interaction
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks required

## Controls

- **Left Click + Drag** - Rotate the camera around the cake
- **Right Click + Drag** - Pan the camera
- **Scroll Wheel** - Zoom in/out

## Browser Compatibility

Works best in modern browsers that support:
- ES6 Modules
- WebGL
- Canvas API

## License

This project is open source and available for personal and educational use.
